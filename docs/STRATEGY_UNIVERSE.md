Strategy research template for Base USDC strategies used by the BlendedVault.

0) Strategy selection principles (v0.1)

Must-haves

USDC-denominated exposure

Prefer ERC‑4626 strategies with synchronous redeem/withdraw

Strong reputation/audits; clear admin/pausing controls

Sufficient liquidity for our expected TVL

Avoid (v0.1)

Leverage/looping

Strategies requiring DEX swaps to exit

Strategies with long withdrawal queues (unless explicitly supported as v2)

1) Data sources

Official protocol docs

Onchain contracts (verified source)

Dune dashboards / DefiLlama / Vault aggregators (for APY/TVL trends)

Security reports / audits

Record exact links and block numbers where relevant.

2) Candidate strategy table

Filled with current Base USDC MetaMorpho vaults from Morpho Blue GraphQL (`https://blue-api.morpho.org/graphql`) filtered by `chainId=8453` and USDC asset `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`.
